# üé¨ IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

## üß† Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on movie reviews using **deep learning (LSTM)**.  
The dataset used is the **IMDB Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains 50,000 reviews labeled as **positive** or **negative**.

Using **TensorFlow / Keras**, the model learns to understand the context of words and predict the overall sentiment of a review.
