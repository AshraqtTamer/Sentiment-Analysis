The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

Al Pacino turns in a stunning performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in Florida. This gangster flick is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word \\\"f--k\\\" the most number of times. Almost three hours long, and yes it can get repulsive. A stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord.<br /><br />Also playing interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression.

oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence  which set in right from the word go  trust me  this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid  this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs  sex or violence  its is hardcore  in the classic use of the word  br    br   it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary  it focuses mainly on emerald city  an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards  so privacy is not high on the agenda  em city is home to many  aryans  muslims  gangstas  latinos  christians  italians  irish and more    so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away  br    br   i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the

me as so nasty it was surreal  i couldn t say i was ready for it  but as i watched more  i developed a taste for oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence  not just violence  but injustice  crooked guards who ll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who ll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of

You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.\",\n          \"Petter Mattei's \\\"Love in the Time of Money\\\" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.\",\n          \"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.<br /><br />This was the most I'd laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her \\\"sexy\\\" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.<br /><br />This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than \\\"Devil Wears Prada\\\" and more interesting than \\\"Superman\\\" a great comedy to go see with friends.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":191},"id":"9fd131b7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761427556528,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":60,"user":{"displayName":"Ashrakat Tamer","userId":"13077231385652285411"}},"outputId":"5f7eaf60-c725-4f81-fbda-6c542ede0178"},"source":["display(df.info())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 50000 entries, 0 to 49999\n","Data columns (total 2 columns):\n"," #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype \n","---  ------     --------------  ----- \n"," 0   review     50000 non-null  object\n"," 1   sentiment  50000 non-null  int64 \n","dtypes: int64(1), object(1)\n","memory usage: 781.4+ KB\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["None"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"id":"f7ca7dd2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761427573243,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":72,"user":{"displayName":"Ashrakat Tamer","userId":"13077231385652285411"}},"outputId":"208e5a7e-2455-44a5-9495-01c8f913ff30"},"source":["display(df.duplicated().sum())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["np.int64(418)"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":191},"id":"e0739f7b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761427589264,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":134,"user":{"displayName":"Ashrakat Tamer","userId":"13077231385652285411"}},"outputId":"f62b994b-0502-4dfc-ff7e-9ed7b1bb2f6f"},"source":["df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\n","display(df.info())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","Index: 49582 entries, 0 to 49999\n","Data columns (total 2 columns):\n"," #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype \n","---  ------     --------------  ----- \n"," 0   review     49582 non-null  object\n"," 1   sentiment  49582 non-null  int64 \n","dtypes: int64(1), object(1)\n","memory usage: 1.1+ MB\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["None"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)\n","\n","print(f\"Test Accuracy: {accuracy*100:.2f}%\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZIQ9Z2dwRTHt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761427677162,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":5966,"user":{"displayName":"Ashrakat Tamer","userId":"13077231385652285411"}},"outputId":"b2129dd9-4cf9-4efb-c0e0-d4f04274e276"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Test Accuracy: 88.05%\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"zfyeTw-8RUdm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPPe4jV+8FIMU4x+n/Xejhd"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
